<p>My name is Jesly Varghese, and this space for me would be an attempt to articulate my thoughts and my attempt towards various parts of life. It is open for people who are interested to read through, to analyse and to discuss. There are no promises of specific articles, or topics. What interest me enough to do a study and inspire me to sit down and articulate it will probably be here.</p>

<a id="embracing-mediocrity" class="anchor" href="#embracing-mediocrity" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Embracing Mediocrity</h3>

<p>It is about setting expectation about myself to mediocre, not a request for others to tolerate my mediocrity or anyones. Setting higher expectation to myself always resulted to be a destructive factor, ended giving up many things I have started. It is an assurance to self, to be okay to fail. To try, over and over again until it is acceptable.</p>
